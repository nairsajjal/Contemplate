Starting out, I never understood why do we need to use another Operating System to run our scripts on. The scripts were fairly basic and would run on any compiler that too on any OS. Yet we were always required by our programming teachers to code on some, or the other Linux Distro.

Well the Journey is fun and is still persevering.

These are my top-picks for the “Coolest Distros” to use in Linux

Coolness is definitely objective and hence will vary from individual to individual. Well to me “COOL” means easy to understand and being powerful enough to some powerful tasks at the same time.
1. Ubuntu (Unity)

This the very basic, our very own Ubuntu distro based on DEBIAN and works on the UNITY shell.
Ubuntu(Unity)

Its a very clean and a much useful distro, perhaps the one which you might have seen the most among your friends or at the Computer Lab in College. This is the easiest shell to install, and you can download the free ISO here

2. Ubuntu(Gnome)

​This Ubuntu distro works on the “Gnome” shell and has a ever-growing fan-base due to its smoother design and multiple workstations options. I have personally used this distro for almost 8 months and had no complaints.
Ubuntu(Gnome)

The Workspaces overview option steals the show along with unique shortcut keys and useful key bindings.

My personal favourite feature in Gnome Ubuntu is the customizable dock (Taskbar) which tries to bear quite an uncanny resemblance to the MacOs Dock.

3. Ubuntu Budgie

​This used to be my favourite distro and it totally replaced Windows 10 on my PC for almost an year. Ubuntu Budgie is a powerhouse, for its compatibility with almost all the processors and the system calls were always fluent, efficient, and effortless. In lay-man terms this system never lagged, no matter how many sub-processes I started, or no matter how slow my internet connection is. This by far had the fastest re-boot time and my GPU used to be most efficient in this distro.

4. Elementary OS

​​Quite frankly I wanted a much needed change from Ubuntu. Ubuntu is great but after sometime you might get bored from its layouts and functionalities. So I pivoted, and boy it was “FUN”.
Elementary OS

Elementary OS is a Linux distribution based on Ubuntu but not quite like it, its way faster, way secure and caters to the need of a more non-technical user. Due its slim build, no third party softwares, less bundled non-sense, this is the best OS for someone who is just starting to use a Desktop. However this OS lacks in the are of support in terms of modules for developers. I mean it has no built in packages, everything must be imported from somewhere else. “BUZZ-KILL”.

Yeah this OS also has a customizable Dock and can really look cool according to what the user may design.

5. Zorin OS 15

​​Yeah this one is on the list. Zorin OS is the most user-friendly, straight-forward, easy to use Operating system I have ever used, and I always run out of adjectives when I talk about Zorin. Zorin is primarily based on Ubuntu but is so much more. The animations are top notch, the pre-bundled softwares are all useful and the OS itself is quite optimized to work on both powerful as well on some well “not-quite” powerful machines. Even the GRUB boot menu is cooler than the usual GRUBS’.

This distro is one which I think I might use for quite sometime.

How To Install a New OS.

Well, once you have decided which OS you want to use or try out the real challenge lies in installing the OS.

There are 2 options for this task :-
a) Dual Boot The new OS along side existing Windows. This works really fine.
b) Use a HyperVisor for booting up LinuxOS onto Windows(use both of them concurrently). This      method works well with powerful PCs but with PC where you do multiple tasks concurrently and the processing speed and space is mediocre this method is highly not recommended.

Personally I prefer the Dual Boot option in-order to fully enjoy every OS without any dependencies from the other one we currently use.

So here is how you Dual Boot your system : -
1. Download the ISO file of the OS you want to install, please do check which bit machine are you using 32-bit or 64-bit and download accordingly.
2. Next, open “Create and format disk partitions” from windows start menu and create an empty partition for your Linux OS(preferably more than 20 GB).

3. Once the ISO image is downloaded the next step is to convert the ISO image into boot-able format. For this you need to install anyone of the following:- RUFUS or Universal USB installer(UUI).

4. After downloading the above said softwares all you need is a USB Drive(of 8gb min). Connect the USB to your PC and then open up RUFUS(or UUI) and select the ISO file downloaded in the first step. Then select the usb drive as the target destination and click on next(or convert). This will extract the ISO onto the Pen-Drive and make it “boot-able”.

5. Once the extraction(conversion) is done remove the USB stick, switch of the PC, restart the PC with the USB stick connected to it. Immediately boot the PC into BOOT-ABLE Mode by either tapping repeatedly on F2 or F12 key (according to your model, like Dell uses the key F2 to open boot-menu).

6. Once the Boot-Menu loads up select the USB drive and voila!! You are good to go.

7. Install the OS by selecting next and selecting the drive you emptied in the 2nd step.
