Creating content for a Web development firm is never an easy task, there are developers with years of experience in Web Design and Development who look through each and every detail of your work and scrutinize everything to such detail that the resulting product is definitely an “Industry Standard”.
My journey of learning the intricate details of Web Development was a very enriching one, probably something that changed the way I look at code and has led to making me more focused towards working in the field of Computer Science.

Consider Computer Science as a big playing field, and Web Development as a chunk of it, but quite a sizeable one.

Here is my path to learning Web Development from scratch and it will cover everything ranging from the Front-End to Back-End and then to deployment to. To keep this article easily readable I will make into two parts, The FrontEnd and then The BackEnd.

<h1>The Frontend</h1>

<h2>HTML and CSS</h2>

HTML although called often the technology of the past, still lies at the core basics and heart of Web Development. Learning the very basics of HTML like various tags and creation of forms, tables, buttons and so much more is very important to learn when you are starting out just to get wind of hat you will be doing. The design will, of course, be out-dated and you might think it's of no use but trust me HTML is the very basic and must be known to all. CSS is a styling language made to make the various things we make in HTML have a better design and view.

Starting out I hated to use CSS as an external style sheet, but CSS is quite necessary, cause one can only learn better things about styling if one has quite some experience in CSS. It has a wide range of transitions, alignment options, classes, ids. CSS teaches you to organize tags you create in HTML into classes and have Ids, while these classes are very different from the object-oriented classes, they pretty much are quite as effective as those classes too!

A personal tip while learning these 2 languages is that once you go through the basic tags and classes, go ahead and create a page. Find out one design you want to create and try to create a web-page that looks as much close to the design you chose. I know it won’t be perfect, maybe you would get frustrated in thinking how can design something more complex if you are not able to design something basic as this. Well, this a good sign, it shows you care and you may worry not because you have this reference to your rescue.

The time you must spend for this stage:- Probably not more than 1 day in learning the very basics and creating at least 1 page. Sometimes it may take more sometimes much lesser, but if my experience serves me correct don’t spend more than 1 day here if you worked hard through the day.

<h2>BOOTSTRAP</h2>

Once you have got your ground basics right and have an idea of how difficult and boring its to design with just the basic HTML, you jump onto the very next best thing, Bootstrap. Bootstrap is such an easy tool yet so powerful at the same time. Bootstrap includes of many classes that you can have in CSS and yeah use as CSS classes that you can make your design much better looking and have that classy style you always wanted. The problems of design that you might have encountered in the previous steps can now be solved using bootstrap. The most important things you can learn in Bootstrap 4 is about Flexboxes, containers, rows, columns. As a reference I might suggest you look up the official Bootstrap documentation, it's really well maintained.
I learnt to implement bootstrap classes by watching bootstrap videos on Youtube. Again the best way to learn bootstrap is by making up a design and also perfecting your previous design. I suggest making a repository and store the work that you do along the way.

An important tip here would be that I learnt a thing about CDNs(content delivery network), don’t worry it's not something scary it's just a way of integrating the Bootstrap Classes into your files. 
The main functionality of Bootstrap is to make the website(web-pages) you make more responsive and fluent. Responsive is a word you will hear a lot at a web-design firm and the thing about this word is that I myself learnt its true meaning with reference to making websites just after a month of actually working at my internship. Responsiveness means that the designs that you make have similar UI no matter what device you are making. For example, if a visitor is viewing your website on a tablet or a different device with different screen-size as that of your laptop. the UI must not break and the website should still look good. Well, to check the responsiveness of a website that you are making you have plenty of tools at your disposal, just check them out by pressing ctrl+shift+i on your keyboard for the major browsers, the developer tools will pop up.

Again one personal tip that I would love to impart is that, practice bootstrap by downloading previously made templates, and try to make designs as close to them as you can. Create carousels, sliders, etc. Just search on the web about Bootstrap4 free templates and you will have an intuition of what to create. Believe me its fairly easy, I did it, so can anyone.

The time you must spend for this stage:- Spend a day or two, make tables, buttons, containers, and everything else you think you might need and test them out using the responsive tools. Again the best reference is the youtube videos as you will learn so much more from seeing someone develop things.

<h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>

Once we know to create the static view of the page, its time to expand. Bootstrap is a lovely tool for creating web-pages but it sure doesn't provide you with everything. Where are those dynamic assets of the page, something that does a task on values, something that computes something, something that changes values. Till now we just have been creating basic views for static websites and now its time to jump and learn the next best(damn easy!) thing Javascript.
Javascript is a scripting language primarily made for front-end dynamic and also static applications. But the amount of growth javascript has had and the amount of developer community support, it's almost an industry standard to at least know the basics. Well but want to create awesome websites, and javascript is just the tool.

Javascript is like any other programming language just far easier, you will find online youtube videos on JavaScript easily along with relevant articles and books that can be downloaded for free. I learnt all of it from the internet itself and boy wasn’t it fun. The most important thing while learning Javascript(Vanilla) is that you must learn how to create functions, how to access and manipulate the DOM elements. How to do calculations and return those elements using .innerHTML function. How to create variables and to use them intelligently. JavaScript is also an object-oriented language and also it's a high-level language and hence it's not as pesky as C or any other machine(low) level language. 

Try creating small web applications using Javascript, you will be amazed by what you can do and how well you can do it. I created an application using javascript and canvas.

The time you must spend for this stage:- Spend at least a week here, learning the syntax like the looping structures, conditionals, etc. Spend another week implementing them and along the way start learning how to use APIs also with javascript. So effectively time required for this stage would be 2 weeks.

APIs are something that make the life of a developer so much easier, learn how to integrate your javascript code with different APIs and create different Web APPs, for instance, I created a weather app using DarkSky and OpenWeatherMap API.

<h2>ReactJS</h2>

Yeah, React can do anything!!

You have learnt the basics, now it's your big moment, now its time to learn something cool and new and then brag about it and write blogs on this topic, showing off how much you have learnt. Now its time to learn to REACT!!!

React is a javascript library(mind it, library and not a framework!) made for building user interfaces. It was created and maintained by the developers at Facebook and boy it is such a useful and cool thing. 
At this stage, you would have many options, as to which framework/library you want to learn for front-end programming, and there are quite a few Angular, Vue.js, Ember, Meteor etc and so much more. But!!! I chose to React because of the simplicity to understand react and the use it and actually see what cool stuff you are doing. React breaks element of the User Interface down into components, components have states and hence can have functions working on those states. Components can be of to types:- Functional and Classful States. Once you get the grip of breaking down elements into states, you will enjoy working with states and functions. The code is far more stable, with optimized SEO and has a blazing fast rendering due to its Virtual DOM. React hooks, routers etc.

Learn by creating websites you previously created and start converting them to React components and use them as components. You will certainly have faster-rendering speed and even the design can be made better using React.

The time you must spend for this stage:- 3 to 4 weeks easily because it's different and far more powerful.
A few tips I would give to someone who is working fresh on React would be to avoid Redux or any other CMS(Content Management System) at this stage because it might get too muddied right now to start with Redux too, and If you have no idea of what am I speaking right now, I got you covered!

<h2>GatsbyJS</h2>

Find all my Gatsby Code at Github

Gatsby is an open-source framework in javascript made for majorly static sites creation.
Wait for a second, did I just say static, but the whole point of learning Javascript was to learn how to create dynamic websites wasn’t it?

The answer is yes, you are right, we want to have dynamic websites and Gatsby being a static site generator doesn't mean it will create static sites only. Gatsby is used to making static pages of the large projects that we make for example in React, Gatsby integrates all the components we make in React and renders them into one static page during “build” and this ensures the website is way faster. 

Gatsby is cutting edge and is almost very easy if you know React, probably would only take you a couple of hours to figure it out with proper knowledge of React and then Voila!! you can now create any kind of a front-end you want in the world.

If you lack the inspiration of what you can create in Gatsby, just open up their official website and go to the starters link, you will find a topic of inspiration and free templates to build on.

Content Management System or popularly called CMS is as its name sounds used to manage all that you have on your content-rich website, suppose you have a Blog Site and you want to add more Blogs in the future, CMS does the job easily for you and helps you to add the content easily.

Wordpress was being conventionally used a lot as CMS, but now its the dawn of a new era, use GatbsyCMS along with Gatsby or NetlifyCMS along with it to easily have the content managed onto your site. 

My advice, after you learn gatsby, go ahead and create your own Blog our your personal portfolio using Gatsby.
The Secrets!

<h1>These are the Bonus Stuff no one hypes much about, but you will learn on the way.</h1>

<h3>These are actually optional stuff but these are something I also use sometimes, so yeah each one of them has functionalities and uses of their own while having a trade off as well. Yet a core front-end developer might know all of these too.<h3>

<h2>Templating Engines-</h2>

This allows you to use static template files in your application and would be very important when you are a full stack developer who isn’t much sticky about the front-end of the project.

At runtime, this engine replaces all the variables that you used in the file with the actual values and converts the template into an HTML file sent over to the client-side.

The engines that I used and you should consider learning too are:-
EJS, HandleBars.

They are fairly very easy, so go ahead and try one.

<h2>Various Smaller frameworks and libraries in JavaScript-<h2>

Javascript has a large community and that is the reason why it has so many frameworks and libraries that make the life of a developer so much more convenient. You can use ScrollMagic to have scrolling effects, Jquery for the earlier versions of the project help out a lot.


I also encountered anime.js, chart.js, cleave.js, D3.js, multiple.js each of which had a different purpose during the time of the project and for different project indeed, but that is the life of a developer, we encounter new things and challenges every day.

<h2>GraphQL</h2>

I was quite unsure about where to include GraphQL, but again GraphQL is very powerful too, yet again optional also. While working with APIs in your project you would want to query data in and out of places, this is where GraphQL comes handy, its a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with the existing data. Created again by the developers at Facebook only, it has large community support and has such amazing performance with React too. I considered GraphQL optional because not many projects use them and starting out if you are also creating small projects GraphQL won't be used anywhere, but GraphQL can be found at large projects especially at companies who take up full websites for different clients and have a sophisticated API framework, GraphQL is definitely used for client-side querying because it scales up better for any project and easily implemented.

<h2>Material-UI</h2>

We can either create our own design or use MaterialUI to design various components in the React Project. Again very helpful for large scale projects and also can be useful for small scale projects as well if you want to easily unify your design.

<h2>SASS(Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)</h2>

Who knew even CSS would become a thing of the past. SASS is a better-precompiled version of CSS as in a way it usees the CSS styles as variables and that can be used at different places throughout the design. This makes your design load much faster and has a better impact on the loading speeds of a website off the bat. Also, it is so easier to follow as you considerably reduce the amount of CSS code you have to write also.
