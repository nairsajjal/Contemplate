Even if you are a beginner who is learning the fundamentals of coding or an absolute professional who is writing code for a company and wants some productivity while writing code, this article is just for you.

The best text/code editor can save you hours of time which you otherwise would have wasted in editing the code you have written. You may use that time to write some world saving code instead!!

The following is my top 5 picks in reverse order for the 5 most practical code editors in 2019.

<h1>5) Gedit</h1>

Gedit tool is an opensource general purpose text editor available for all the three major platforms i.e. Windows, Mac, Linux and is free. It includes features for editing source code and structured text like markup languages. It has support for highlighting almost all the major languages. It has support for text wrapping and auto indentation. Search and replace function etc.

The drawbacks(which are many) include no version control, no plugins and extension management ontegrated into the editor. This editor is just for the very basic that is to write code, edit code thats it.

Command to install Gedit
<b><i>$ sudo apt-get install gedit</i></b>

<h1>4) NotePad++</h1>
Its one the most popular, free code editor written in C++. Has a better execution speed and smaller program size than the rest of the editors in this list. Currently its available only for Windows Platform and hence linux and MacOS users would be very unhappy.

The application supports various programming languages, but it is typically known for being the best HTML editor. The application supports colored lines while writing the syntax of the language and further highlights the mistakes in the code immediately.

The only drawbacks I found were that remote file editing doesn't support HHTP, SSH, or WebDAV and Notepadd++ doesnt support large files.

3) Sublime Text
Sublime Text is also an another light weight text editor, great for python scripting. The black backgroound for the enhanced view is a major contributing factor for the fame of this editor. 
It has instant file switching along with syntax detection and OpenFL integration via plugin support.

Its quite popular among the web developers.

The obvious drawbacks I found were again of version control integration, no terminal support, and lack of many plugins along with poor support for Linux. Also the app crached frequently on prolonged usage.

2) Atom
Atom was created by the great team at GitHub and looks quite alot like sublime text, but has a much more simpler interface as compared to the Sublime Text.

It has package manager integrated for plugins support and has a bunch of developer tools.

The only cons include its sluggishness when its speed is comared to the other editors.

1) Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code is by far the best Text editor I have ever experienced. It can be used for free across all the platforms namely Linux, MacOS and Windows. This editor is lightweight and blazing-fast and has a very low RAM usage.
Bundled along with Git version Control and debugging features it works like a dream for every web developer.

It has support for more than 34 Programming languages with plugins and extensions for each one of them. It has a wide community and that community contributes alot regularly to make this product the best editor in our list. The integrated Terminal also makes it easier for any coder to work on the terminal executing the files he just created without any hassle.

The list is short crisp and to the point, there are plenty of code editors out there and you may try any one of them. At the end it always comes down to preferance, one coder prefers some other style of coding while someone prefers some other. But the elements on this list wil surely never disappoint you.
