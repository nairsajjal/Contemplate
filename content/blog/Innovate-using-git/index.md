Modern Day Version Control has its origins in 1982 when Walter F. Tichy of Purdue university created an alternative to the then-popular Source Code Control System developed by IBM in 1972. The Version Control paradigm never remained the same.

The current Version Comtrol Softwares include Git, Mercurial, SVN, CVS.

In simple terms, Version Control is the efficient management of the documents, source code, code files, code dependencies in order to remove redundant information which may otherwise have created deployment failures and errors.

The intuition of this post is to how to get started with the most popular version control today and how it can actually make you productive.

<h1>GIT</h1>

Git was launched on April 7, 2005, as a distributed version control system for analysing and tracking all the changes made in the code during the software development lifecycle.

Basically what does, is to track all the changes you make to a file in your project and helps you have a Log of all such changes so that you may recover from bugs or errors that might have crept in, or simply for code review of a project in which multiple project members are contributing.

According to Wiki, GIT’s goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

<h2>Usage</h2>

Initializing and using GIT for your project is comparatively very easy. All you have to understand is the easy concept of what Git is and it can do and the commands are relatively straightforward and easy.


Suppose you have a project in which multiple contributors(or coders) are contributing to complete the project. There is always a master branch which tells which is the mainstream of the project, or which version is the original and the final project for implementation. Changes can be made to separate branches and then merged or pushed onto the master branch for merging.

<h2>Installation</h2>

Linux commands to install git is

<b><i>$ sudo apt-get install git</i></b>

For Windows install git by downloading the installer from the official website.

<b><i>www.git.scm.com/downoads</i></b>

After installing the Git for CLI you have an option to install the GUI for Git but it's totally up to your preferences to do so, I personally prefer to install the CLI tools only.

The next step involves you adding your details for the Git to know which user is using it. This step has to be done in the root directory. The commands are as follows

<b><i>$ git config — global user.name “Your Name”</i></b>
<b><i>$ git config — global user.email “youremaili@domain.com”</i></b>

if you need to edit this file, you can use a text editor such as nano;-

<b><i>$ nano ~/.gitconfig</i></b>

That's it, you are good to go, that's how easy it is to install Git on your device.

After setting up Git the next practical step is to make an account on any preferred git repository hosting service like GitHub, GitBucket, GitLab, BitBucket, SourceForge, Launchpad. It always comes down to the personal preference as to which service you want to use. As to me, I preferred the widely used GitHub as it was more user-friendly and has a wide array of project management tools which make it easier to manage a Project and increase productivity.

<h1>GITHUB</h1>

The best service yet and most widely used Git repository hosting service today is GitHub. Often termed as the future of open source GitHub was acquired by tech giant Microsoft in June 2018. Git continues to operate as a community, platform and business.

Coming to what GitHub is, it is a web-based version-control and collaboration platform for software developers. Its provisioned as a Software-as-a-service business model. It lets you create unlimited public repositories for free. Private repositories can be created by paying some operational cost for security privileges. As a whole, it packs with itself a whole plethora of tools for hosting, deployment, CI/CD(Continous Integration and Continous platform) pipelines, automation platforms and toolkits.

Check out the website to know more about a wide range of industry standards GitHub has collaborated with and has toolkits for.

To get an intuition of how to work with GitHub, create a free account on GitHub using your Gmail account. Create a test repository and add files onto the hub. Refer the following guides for more information.

<h1>How to get productive and use GitHub to its fullest potential.</h1>

The main USP of GitHub is that it has a complete student starter pack for students who are yet studying under a deemed university or college. The Student Started Pack comes with a wide range of professional toolkits which you can apply to your projects and be more productivity. There are various apps bundled with this feature that allow you to manage your tasks by using industry-standard productivity methods. All of this including web development hosting, deployment and testing platforms for no additional cost(free) make this deal a must for any college student.

Creating projects on GitHub is easy and fun as it has functionalities for you to create and manage tasks, assign the priorities, raise issues, flags, manage pull requests and so much more. All I wish is that I could have known more about all of this beforehand.
